INTRODUCTION                                                *nvim-coderun-intro*

`nvim-coderun` is a plugin for running projects and code in nvim, it finds
the root directory of the current project by inspecting ancestors
folders, starting from the current file.

The command is executed using `term://` in a terminal opened in a new pane,
this allows custom execution and REPL configuration with current file.

================================================================================
CONFIGURATION                                              *nvim-coderun-config*

`nvim-coderun` provides a setup function to configure code runners, for example:

>

  require('nvim-coderun').setup {
    ftypes = {
      go = {
        files = { 'go.mod' },
        run = { -- Default task configuration
          cmd = 'go run $file',
        }
      }
    }
  }

<

An example with `cmd_function`:

>

  require('nvim-coderun').setup {
    ftypes = {
      go = {
        files = { 'go.mod' },
        run = {
          cmd_function = function(attrs)
            return 'go run ' .. attrs.file_escape(attrs.currentFile)
          end
        }
      }
    }

<

The `setup{}` takes a table with the following fields:

- `ftypes` `table <string, table>`

  A table with file types and their configuration.

- `ftypes.<filetype>` `table <string, table>`

  A table with configuration for a specific file type.

- `ftypes.<filetype>.files` `list[string]`

  A list of files which to determine the project root,
  a ancestor lookup is done until one of the files is found.

  **Glob patterns are supported**, for example: `*.nimble`

- `ftypes.<filetype>.<task>` `table <string, table>`

  A table with configuration for a specific task.

- `ftypes.<filetype>.run` `table <string, table>`

  The default configuration to run the project,
  when no task is specified in the command execution.

- `ftypes.<filetype>.<task>.cmd` `string | nil`
  
  The command to run the project when the underlying
  `<task>` is executed.

  The following placeholders are available:

  - `$file` The current file

- `ftypes.<filetype>.<task>.cmd_function` `function(attributes)`

  A function which returns the command to run the project,
  this allow further customization of the command based
  on the provided `attributes`.

  The values provided in the `attributes` table are:

  - `currentFile` `string` 
    
    The file opened in the current buffer.

    It's important to make sure that the opened
    buffer is not the command output buffer, otherwise
    you will not be able to run the project.

  - `root` `string`
  
    The root directory of the project.

  - `files` `list[string]`
    
    A list of files that matched the `ftypes.<filetype>.files`.

  - `args` `table<integer, string>`

    A table with variadic arguments provided to `:CodeRun` command,
    the first argument (task name) is not included.

  - `file_escape` `function(path)`

    A function which escapes paths before passing them to the
    command.
    This is needed for paths that contains spaces, single quotes
    and double quotes, as they are interpreted as seperated arguments
    when not escaped properly.

    Also, it is important to note that commands that has those special
    characters will not work properly.
================================================================================
USAGE                                                       *nvim-coderun-usage* 

To run a project, use the `:CodeRun` command, by default it will run the
`run` task (which is the default task), to run a specific task, provide
an argument to the command, example: `:CodeRun release`.

You can also map a key to the `:CodeRun` command, for example:

>

  nmap <C-r> :<c-u>CodeRun<cr>

<

And for custom tasks:

>

  nmap <C-R> :<c-u>CodeRun release<cr>
